The phrase "beating the market" means earning an investment return that exceeds the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Commonly called the S&P 500, it's one of the most popular benchmarks of the overall U.S. stock market performance.
Everybody tries to beat the SP500, but few succeed! This code aims to provide a tool to quickly evaluate the performance of Nasdaq and NYSE stocks relative to the SP500 index.
The code calculates cumulative returns for each ticker and compares it to the SP500 return for the same period.

The link above provides a CSV file with all the tickers. 
For this exercise, we will use Yahoo Finance API to automatically pull all SP500 stocks.
